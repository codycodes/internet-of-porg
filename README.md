## About
The NodeMCU is an open-source firmware and development kit which allows us to use a low-cost ESP8266 WiFi MCU to provide “the best platform for IOT application development at the lowest cost” [NodeMCU homepage](https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html).  

ESPHome is the software and firmware flasher we’ll be using; it’s a “system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Automation systems” [ESPHome homepage](https://esphome.io).

## Upon Completion
By completing this project you will have a porg or other hacked 5v plush which can wave be invoked via web request over the Internet!
